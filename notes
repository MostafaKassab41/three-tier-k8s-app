e 1 — Pla

📍 Phase 1 — Planning & Environment Setup
Goal: Prepare everything before starting development and automation.

Define project scope & architecture (3-tier app: frontend, backend, DB).
Choose single GitHub repo structure.
Set up .gitignore, README, and branch strategy.
Install local tools: Docker, kubectl, Helm, Terraform, Ansible, Trivy, SonarQube CLI, OWASP Dependency-Check CLI.
Configure AWS account and IAM for Terraform.
Decide Kubernetes hosting: EC2-based cluster.

📍 Phase 2 — Application Containerization
Goal: Create secure, optimized Docker images.

Create Dockerfiles for frontend & backend.
Add .dockerignore to reduce image size.
Build & test images locally.
Run via docker-compose for local validation.
Security Step: Run Trivy on each image and fix vulnerabilities.

📍 Phase 3 — Static Code & Dependency Analysis
Goal: Find security issues before deploying.

Run SonarQube locally or in a container for code quality & bugs.
Run OWASP Dependency-Check to detect vulnerable libraries.
Fix reported issues where possible.

📍 Phase 4 — Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Goal: Automate cloud resource creation using Terraform.

Terraform to create:
VPC, subnets, routing tables, security groups.
EC2 instances for Kubernetes cluster.
S3 bucket for Terraform state backend.
Store .tf files in infra/terraform/.
Validate with terraform plan → apply with terraform apply.

📍 Phase 5 — Configuration Management
Goal: Automate OS and software setup using Ansible.

Use Ansible to:
Install Docker, Kubernetes, Helm on EC2 nodes.
Configure users, permissions, networking.
Store playbooks in infra/ansible/.

📍 Phase 6 — Kubernetes Deployment
Goal: Deploy app to the Kubernetes cluster.

Write Helm charts for frontend, backend, and MongoDB.
Apply with helm install.
Add Kubernetes secrets for DB credentials.
Test with kubectl port-forward or LoadBalancer.

📍 Phase 7 — Continuous Integration (CI)
Goal: Automate testing, building, and scanning.

GitHub Actions workflow:
Run linting, unit tests.
Run Trivy & OWASP check in pipeline.
Run SonarQube scan in pipeline.
Build and push Docker images to AWS ECR.

📍 Phase 8 — Continuous Delivery & Deployment (CD)
Goal: Automate Kubernetes deployment with ArgoCD.

Install ArgoCD in cluster.
Connect repo to ArgoCD app definition.
Auto-sync manifests from GitHub to cluster.

📍 Phase 9 — Monitoring & Logging
Goal: Ensure observability & alerting.

Deploy Prometheus for metrics.
Deploy Grafana for dashboards.
Configure alerts for high CPU/memory, failed pods.

📍 Phase 10 — Security & Compliance
Goal: Maintain ongoing security.

Periodic Trivy scans on running containers.
SonarQube quality gates in CI/CD.
Dependency monitoring with OWASP.
Kubernetes network policies & RBAC hardening.

📍 Phase 11 — Documentation & Final Delivery
Goal: Make the project reproducible & easy to understand.

Update README with architecture, setup, and CI/CD explanation.
Export diagrams for infrastructure and pipeline.
Prepare demo & presentation.
